Hipsters on Networks: How a Small Group of Individuals Can Lead to an Anti-Establishment Majority 
Juu, Jonas S.; Porter, Mason A., arXiv (July 25, 2017): 1-14

Juu and Porter observe that starting anti-establishment nodes in a network can have a large effect on the entire's network final state. Using a threshold model which imitates the spread of processes on networks, they were able to simulate different amounts of starting anti-conformists nodes in order to see the different outcomes on the network. When the model began with less than 10% of anti-conformists, the state would become equal to the conformists, which explains the spread of misinformation, memes, and products. The simulations from different models support the authors' conclusions that anti-conformists have a large effect on the overall network.
