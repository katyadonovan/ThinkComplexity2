Richard Mann and Dirk Helbing investigate the importance of diversity of thought in groups, examining factors such as groupthink and conformity that reduce diversity. Using an evolutionary game-theoretic model of collective prediction, they observe the effect that outside motivations, such as rewards for unique thoughts when the mass is wrong, on the overall diversity of ideas. Their design, created through analysis and simulation, shows the effects of a reward system on groupthink. Their simulations demonstrate that minority rewards have the greatest effect on accuracy, where market rewards are ineffective. Binary reward is one that is given to the agent if they make an accurate prediction, whereas the market rewards are fixed awards spread among a group of people. This model indicates that binary rewards, or encouraging individuals to share their own ideas, can provide a higher collective intelligence.
