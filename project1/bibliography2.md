Goldstein, Jeffrey , Hazy, James K. and Silberstang, Joyce(2010) 'A Complexity Science Model of Social Innovation in Social Enterprise', Journal of Social Entrepreneurship, 1: 1, 101 â€” 125

Goldstein, Hazy, and Silberstang explore social innovation in social enterprises using a simulation which uses nonlinear dynanimical systems that represent the changes in social innovation, and the cusp catastrophe model to represent emerging solutions for social problems. By observing the relationship between social innovation wiithin social enterprises, Goldstein, Hazy, and Silberstang can simulate what social enterprises practices may produce the most innovation, encouraging new systems to current businesses. Their design approach reveal why certain practices should be implemented, having even implemented some of their organizational structures in two cases of social entrepreneurial ventures. In the end, these two social entrepreneurial ventures adopted these practices, bringing their creative ideas to business models.
