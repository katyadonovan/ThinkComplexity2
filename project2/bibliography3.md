Xiaoling Sun, Jasleen Kaur, Stasa Milojevic, Alessandro Flammini and Filippo Menczer propose an agent-based model of the evolution of disciplines. They model disciplines emerging from social communities collaborating and splitting off, which supports the role of social interactions in the history of science. This study is the first account that supports the emergence of disciplines with empirical data.
