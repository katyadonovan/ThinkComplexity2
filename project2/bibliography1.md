Ramos R.T., Sassi R.B., Piqueira J.R.C., (18 February 2010). *Self-organized criticality and the predictability of human behavior.* Volume 29, Issue 1. ScienceDirect.
Ramos and Sassi propose that the human behavior in a social context exhibits self-organized criticality by testing data from individuals evaluated by a therapist and of medical students. For each category, the data was organized in order to determine whether it followed the power law.  If human behavior exhibits self-organized criticality, then modeling complex human behavior might be simpler, which would aid in diagnoses and understanding human mental behaviors.
