Biondo, Pluchino, and Rapisarda design a financial market model that is characterized by self-organized criticality to predict realistic prices. They verify that the model follows self-organized criticality by determining that the number of avalanches and size of avalanches is a power-law distribution. They also examine that the model follows a Guassian distribution, (the PDF of the normalized returns), which is similar to the actual financial market. This model provides realistic time-price series which can be useful for analyzing financial markets.
